21/07/2022, 11:54 - +254 705 919808: I think there should also be a google doc with all these questions then each group can tackle a specific section until they perfect it then that's how we can exchange. Idk if this seems okay but for example under sorting algorithms everyone does each algorithm (well the relevant ones) then we discuss if its searching algorithms tunaenda hivo in a systemic way. It will be easier to understand that way in my opinion

21/07/2022, 12:16 - +254 732 954865: True... it's good to know atleast 1 language.

23/07/2022, 13:42 - +254 732 954865: The 1st goal is to divide ourselves in groups. So my question is h9w many do you guys prefere in a group? 3 or 4?

23/07/2022, 13:46 - +254 732 954865: In terms of group I think for better collaboration, we shall devide ourselves according to our language proficiency
23/07/2022, 13:46 - +254 732 954865: groups*
23/07/2022, 13:46 - +254 742 845204: Best idea

23/07/2022, 13:50 - +254 732 954865: For those wondering why groups...managing all of us cannot be possible. Also we can easily watch out and encourage each other. And so many other benefits
23/07/2022, 13:52 - +254 732 954865: The thing is this won't be easyüòÇ(I hope y'all know that). You have to push yourself even if you don't feel like it. So buckle up!

23/07/2022, 13:54 - +254 732 954865: One more important question...do you all think we should give time frames? Like finish all the topics in 3 months? Finish 1 topic in 1 or 2 days?

23/07/2022, 13:59 - +254 732 954865: Awesome... So 1 topic should go 2 days max?
23/07/2022, 14:00 - +254 732 954865: Alright 3 it is
23/07/2022, 14:00 - +254 732 954865: But I shall need someone to help me with thatüòÇüòÇany volunteer?
23/07/2022, 14:01 - +254 742 845204: There is no already established software engineer in the house?
23/07/2022, 14:02 - +254 732 954865: All the names are here.

You just need to sort them according to the language they like. Then put them in groups like, group-1, group-2 and so on

(Types of O notation, what it means and how you can calculate it from a function.)

25/07/2022, 10:45 - +254 705 919808: For the ones new to programming please start off by learning what is a program? What is pseudocode ? And what is an algorithm.

From there understand that any program you write should always limit space used and time taken.
That is the purpose of Big O

Incase anyone is confused

03/08/2022, 08:43 - +254 742 845204: If you are newbie and you want to persue *web development* 

you can start with HTML,CSS ,JS ,REACT ,NODE , EXPRESS, MONGODB

It will take you just 6Months to be fit and become a Fullstack... remember when learning do some small projects like for 1. Html,css build some simple UI like one page ,two page design

2. HTML,css ,js 

build a weather app ,as this will also teach you how to do with APIs

3. React 

Try to design the Weather app with react js 

Node Express Mongodb

Try to create a CRUD API 

which is like you can post , delete , edit data in the database ( Mongodb)

4. Fullstack

Now you can combine your React + node, express, Mongdb , create a basic frontend UI where user can add ,delete and edit items ,you can also track those data he inputs your database

5. Learning doesn't stop... keep going

A start up needs someone good with java and familiar with react native. Who's interested?

03/08/2022, 21:36 - +234 803 395 4301: Hi Group 5 members, we are waiting for you!
03/08/2022, 23:25 - +254 705 919808: group5 when you go back to that code the way Samuel was asking, our START becomes midpoint-1 so now that becomes our new index 0 and then now it will find the midpoint from behind. Mid-1 is not the midpoint @2348033954301
03/08/2022, 23:26 - +254 705 919808: hope that clears everything we'll go through some more of it tomorrow
03/08/2022, 23:27 - +234 909 007 3211: Thank you bro , I got in ‚úÖ
03/08/2022, 23:27 - +254 705 919808: here's the code: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TuZcviK9r_6qiBlSsnyBG7LtnLaDdWixELhoQuAJXdg/edit
03/08/2022, 23:42 - +234 803 395 4301: Thanks @254705919808 ! What I meant was that looking for something on the left side of the array will trigger an infinite loop if you don't adjust the *end* variable in the else statement.
03/08/2022, 23:43 - +234 803 395 4301: Thanks for your help in understanding O(logN) better.
03/08/2022, 23:52 - +254 705 919808: Nope because end will always be the last item in the new list and as the loop goes on and on the list gets smaller so there's no infinite loop anywhere because if the item exists it will be found and if not it will return false
03/08/2022, 23:53 - +254 705 919808: I think I'll need some animation to explain better
03/08/2022, 23:54 - +254 705 919808: If you check the code and always remember array.length will always change and it will get smaller and smaller each iteration 

Don't forget the side we don't want becomes invisible to the program.  The side we want becomes the new array
03/08/2022, 23:57 - +254 705 919808: End is automatic we don't adjust it
04/08/2022, 00:01 - +234 803 395 4301: <Media omitted>
04/08/2022, 00:02 - +234 803 395 4301: When I search for elements on the rights, like 12, 10, 9 it works, but not the other way round
04/08/2022, 00:03 - +254 705 919808: Its just always our last item either to the left or right

0, 11 ,20 ,25 ,36
Target  =0
First midpoint = 20

Is 20 less than target? (0)
No it's more than 0 so zero must be to the left of 20. Ignore  the right side and make START = MIDPOINT-1

MIDPOINT-1 = 11

So now 11 is our NEW START 

if we ignore the right side we are left with 0 and 11 
Array. Length  becomes 2  and end is 0 


So you see?  Never will we have an infinite loop
04/08/2022, 00:04 - +254 705 919808: The program works either way whether items are left or right if it's not there it won't be found.
04/08/2022, 00:04 - +254 705 919808: Also did you math.floor
04/08/2022, 00:05 - +254 705 919808: Otherwise it won't work with an arraylist that's not divisible  by 2
04/08/2022, 00:06 - +254 705 919808: Math.floor

04/08/2022, 12:35 - +254 705 919808: guys I've updated the code @2348033954301  was right all along üôÜüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è If we iterate backwards the array becomes unsorted so our new END will be midpoint-1 not START
04/08/2022, 12:35 - +254 705 919808: lets do this again
04/08/2022, 12:35 - +254 705 919808: 12, 24, 56, 78
04/08/2022, 12:40 - +254 705 919808: target = 12
first midpoint = 56
is 56 > or < OUR TARGET OF 0?
56 is greater yeah ? so 12 will be to the left side of 56 so ignore the right side

NB!!!! REMEMBER ALWAYS THE ARRAY HAS TO BE SORTED IN ORDER so ....
midpoint-1 becomes 24 but if the array is sorted!!! 12 should be the first index so our START CANNOT BE 24 as the array will not be sorted

if 24 becomes our NEW START the array will look like this (24, 12)
its not sorted

so midpoint-1 is OUR NEW END!

MEANING 24 WILL BE THE NEW LAST VALUE
if 24 is the new last value and we have 12, 24

do the serach again
04/08/2022, 12:40 - +254 705 919808: search*
04/08/2022, 12:44 - +254 705 919808: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TuZcviK9r_6qiBlSsnyBG7LtnLaDdWixELhoQuAJXdg/edit yes now if we search left or right it works!!! It was not searching on the left side due to the array not being sorted because REMEMBER the array HAS TO BE SORTED in order to search with 0logn
04/08/2022, 12:44 - +254 705 919808: thank you again @2348033954301
04/08/2022, 12:52 - +234 803 395 4301: No, thank you for the devotion.
04/08/2022, 12:55 - +254 705 919808: 0, 35, 78, 89, 100, 134, 155
target =35
first midpoint ( divide the array index by 2) == 6/2 == 3
First iteration our midpoint is 89
is 89 bigger or smaller than our target of 35? its bigger so 35 cant be on the right side (OUR ARRAY IS SORTED SO TO THE RIGHT VALUES ARE BIGGER TO THE LEFT THEY ARE SMALLER)
SINCE 89 IS BIGGER than target of 35 ignore the right side (we'll ignore 89, 100, 134, 155)
so now we are left with 0, 35, 78

we shift our midpoint to PREVIOUS MIDPOINT -1 /// OUR NEW MID IS NOW 78 
78 WILL NOW MARK THE NEW END
NOT THE START

COZ IF WE START AT 78..... ( OUR ARRAY READS 78, 35, 0) Its not sorted see if we look for 35 it will be to the right but our program knows the right side has larger values 

hence... 78 becomes the NEW END for the array to be like  0, 35, 78
04/08/2022, 12:55 - +254 705 919808: I hope that explains it better

04/08/2022, 13:13 - +254 705 919808: also just to add on this if our target was maybe 100 (something to the right side ) then OUR START is the one that changes so MIDPOINT+1 becomes START
04/08/2022, 13:13 - +254 705 919808: to the left its END
